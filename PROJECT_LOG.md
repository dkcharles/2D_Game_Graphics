# Project Log: 2D Game Graphics Pixel Art Course

## Project Overview
Interactive web-based pixel art course for Unity game development with 6 weeks of progressive content, featuring sub-tab navigation and interactive canvas tools.

## Development Progress

### Phase 1: Initial Structure âœ… COMPLETE
- **Week 1-3 Content Development**: Full educational content implementation
- **Sub-tab Navigation System**: 6 tabs per week (Overview, Concepts, Practice 1, Practice 2, Challenge, Assessment)
- **Interactive Canvas System**: Multiple canvas types with drawing tools
- **File Architecture**: Separated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into maintainable modules

### Phase 2: Visual Enhancement Project âœ… COMPLETE
- **Educational Visual Examples**: Created comprehensive SVG-based pixel art examples
- **Week 2 Enhancements**: Added color theory and shading visual references
- **Week 3 Character Design**: Created character silhouettes, design fundamentals, and feature examples
- **Responsive Design System**: CSS classes for visual example integration
- **Reference Integration**: Video links, resource tables, and external reference materials

### Phase 3: Student Task Development âœ… COMPLETE
- **Clear Learning Objectives**: Added specific, actionable tasks for each practice session
- **Week 2 Tasks**: Color harmony study (3 compositions) and 3-shade system mastery (geometric shapes)
- **Week 3 Tasks**: Character silhouette creation (hero/villain/friend archetypes) and feature development (age/emotion expression)
- **Assessment Criteria**: Success metrics and step-by-step guidance for each assignment
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Integrated inclusive design principles throughout curriculum

## Current Status: Weeks 1-3 First Full Iteration Complete âœ…

### Completed Features:
- âœ… **Week 1**: Pixel Art Basics with foundational exercises
- âœ… **Week 2**: Color Theory & Shading with visual examples and clear tasks
- âœ… **Week 3**: Character Design with comprehensive visual guides and structured assignments

- âœ… **Visual Example Library**: 15+ SVG educational illustrations
- âœ… **Student Task Framework**: Clear assignments with success criteria
- âœ… **Reference Resources**: External video links, downloadable guides, and resource tables

### Technical Implementation:
- **HTML Structure**: 151 lines, clean template-based organization
- **CSS Styling**: 513 lines, responsive design with visual example classes
- **JavaScript Logic**: 2,735 lines across 3 files (canvas.js, content.js, main.js)
- **Canvas Classes**: 5 different canvas types for varied exercise needs
- **Content Management**: Modular system allowing easy updates per week/tab

### Educational Content Quality:
- **Progressive Learning**: Each week builds on previous concepts
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Inclusive design principles integrated throughout
- **Professional Workflow**: Industry-standard practices and techniques
- **Practical Application**: Clear connection to Unity game development

## Next Phase: Weeks 4-6 Development ðŸŽ¯ UPCOMING

### Week 4: Environment Art & Tilemaps
- **Focus**: Landscape design, tile-based environments, seamless patterns
- **Planned Tasks**: Tile creation, environment composition, pattern design
- **Visual Examples Needed**: Tile alignment, environmental storytelling, texture patterns

### Week 5: Animation
- **Focus**: Frame-by-frame animation, timing, motion principles
- **Planned Tasks**: Character walk cycles, object animations, effect animations
- **Visual Examples Needed**: Animation principles, timing charts, onion skinning demos

### Week 6: Unity Integration
- **Focus**: Import workflows, sprite setup, optimization for games
- **Planned Tasks**: Unity asset preparation, sprite atlas creation, performance optimization
- **Visual Examples Needed**: Unity interface guides, asset organization, import settings

## Development Methodology
1. **Content Structure**: Establish educational framework for each week
2. **Visual Examples**: Create pixel-perfect SVG illustrations for concepts
3. **Student Tasks**: Design clear, achievable assignments with success criteria
4. **Testing & Refinement**: Validate educational effectiveness and technical functionality

## File Organization
```
