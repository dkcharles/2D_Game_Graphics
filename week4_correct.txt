                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Universal Themes:</strong> Focus on shared human experiences</li>
                                <li><strong>Natural Elements:</strong> Emphasize natural rather than cultural wear patterns</li>
                                <li><strong>Generic Tools:</strong> Avoid culturally specific implements or symbols</li>
                                <li><strong>Respectful Research:</strong> If adding cultural elements, understand their significance</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Advanced Tile Design Concepts:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Modular Systems:</strong> Tiles that combine in multiple ways</li>
                                <li><strong>Layered Details:</strong> Background base with foreground elements</li>
                                <li><strong>Seasonal Variations:</strong> Same location in different weather/seasons</li>
                                <li><strong>Damage States:</strong> Pristine to worn versions of the same tile</li>
                                <li><strong>Interactive Elements:</strong> Tiles that suggest player interaction</li>
                            </ul>
